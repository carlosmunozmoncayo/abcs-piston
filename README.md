===========================================================================
Reproducibility repository for the paper **Efficient absorbing boundary conditions for conservation laws: Application to the piston problem of gas dynamics** by Carlos Mu√±oz-Moncayo

### Dependencies
  - python (v3.8.9)
  - numpy (v1.23.3)
  - matplotlib (v3.6.3)
  - f2py (v1.22.3)
  - A Fortran compiler (GNU Fortran compiler v11.2.0)
  - Clawpack (v5.9.2)

The Jupyter Notebooks contain descriptions of their uses. Before running them, the Riemann solvers and the code for the NDO ABC must be compiled with f2py. For this, it suffices to run the bash scripts **compile.sh** in the corresponding directories.
